Debouncing

            Debouncing in JavaScript can be defined as the technique 
            that is used to limit the number of times a function gets 
            executed. Debouncing is useful when the event is frequently
             being triggered in a short interval of time like typing, 
             scrolling, and resizing.
        <hr>
             After the specific delay only the function is executed, ensuring no rapid consecutive calls.
