    <h2>IIFE</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined.</p>
    <p>The Revealing Module Pattern in JavaScript is a design pattern used to encapsulate private data and functions while exposing only selected parts of the module to the outside world.

It is an extension of the Module Pattern and is usually implemented using an IIFE.</p>
